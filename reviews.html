                    <p class="align-left"><q>Delicious! I meet friends here once a week for spicy food, hard tequila and cheap beer... It's always packed and the busy...definitely a good sign... A must visit when in town...</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>The food and service is always great! They are great for take out. Love the chicken and mixed vegetables.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>By far one of my favorite places to eat! Love the staff and the regulars - it's like our own little "Cheers" bar! The food is always great, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the music on the weekends.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>I've eaten at other Chinese restaurants in the area, and was less then impressed. My sons friends suggested we go here, so we did. The place was hopping, but you would never know it. The service was amazing and the food was great!  The portions are huge!  We had a ton leftover and ended up eating off this one meal for 2 more days. Definitely will return.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>I've been to other La Parilla locations, and the food is consistently very good. This location is no exception to that. The food was fresh, the ambience and speed of service were above average, and the service was exceptional. I even missed an ingredient in the menu item, and my server, Samantha, offered to make me a new one without any hesitation. Javier, the manager was also incredibly friendly. I'll definitely be back in the near future.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>In all the years of ordering Chinese, whether it is pick up or delivery, there are only two locations that I can say with 90% plus certainty that the order will be correct and the food fantastic.  This would be one, and my favorite to boot.  I have been ordering delivery multiple times per month for years.  I believe I have had mistakes 2 -3 times, and they brought me the forgotten item the one time I called.  The food is always hot and very good.  Fantastic flavors with fresh ingredients and generous portions.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>Great food, large portions, reasonable prices, terrific service. Come here about once a week for lunch.</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>Delicious Mexican food.  Our waitress Myrna did a fantastic job.  We will definitely return in the future.  Food was very tasty and well prepared.  I love Mexican food and this place did not disappoint</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>I don't know why I've never given them a review before. We love this restaurant. We have come here about twice a month since we moved here a year ago. The portions are huge. We always have leftovers for the next day. I love the Sesame Chicken, General Chicken, Green Pepper Beef, and Won Ton Soup. Really, nothing is bad on the menu. Some of the items are a little bit different from traditional Chinese that I've had before, bit ate still great! I would recommend them to everyone!</q></p>
                    
                    <p class="align-left"><q>Much better, had burrito a la parrila. Steak, med well.   Skinny margarita knocked me out. Nice that they have a patio.</q></p>
